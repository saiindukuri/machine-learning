## Proposal


### Domain Background

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. There is lot of buzz about cryptocurrency and everyday in the news we hear volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. 

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The extremely nonlinear nature of the crypto market data makes it very difficult to design a system that can predict the future direction of the crypto prices in Bitcoin with sufficient accuracy. Goal of the project is to predict price movements(that's either up or down) of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

Bitcoin is actual implementation of decentralization issued under the consent of participants not the central bank. Hence variants like purchasing power or interest rate parity does not impact Bitcoin. Bitcoin price is largly impacted by demand and supply.16.5 million Bitcoins are mined since it was created and the Bitcoins are capped at 21 millions part of the reason for scarcity and rush.

Hence to predict Bitcoin price we need to predict Demand and Supply. Block chain is the technology used to create Bitcoin."Block Chain information" along with "Bitcoin" trading information includes features that can determine demand and supply and hence the price.

Therefore, the project uses historic block chain information and Bitcoin trading information to predict future Bitcoin prices.

This project uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory which is publicly available. The data consist of "Bitcoin_Dataset" which consist of historic Block chain information and Bitcoin prices for  last 4 years.

### Solution Statement

The main goal of speculating a cryptocurrency price is to make profitable trades. To make profitable trades one doesn't need to know accurate value of the cryptocurrency price, but one mearely needs to predict wether prices rise or fall. In these lines we will train our models to classify subsequent day's closing price to be likely higher and lower than the last, based on past 10 days price data.

The solution tests the data on selected features using the models learnt in this course(Linear regression, SVM and Random Forest) to pick a best model.

### Benchmark Model

We will start with building model that would get results better than Naive prediction and will improve the model from there.


### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

The solution will be evaluated based on Accuracy.


### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

Data Exploration:
Data Exploration will involve exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. We will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which we will track through the course of this project.

Feature Relevance and selection:
Feature relevance will involve identifying relevance of features and selecting the features by determining their correlation coefficient and building scatter matrix. 

Feature Scaling:
In feature scaling data is evaluated for normal distribution. In case the data is not normally distributed, most likely with financial data, non linear scaling is applied by applying natural logarithm.

Outlier Detection:
Detecting outliers is very important as the outliers can skew the results. Outlier steps are calculated based on 1.5 times the interquartile range. Any data point outside the outlier step will be identified as outlier.

Feature Transformation:
Feature transformation involves using Principle componant analysis(PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the data. Dimentionality analysis is performed to identify least number of dimensions needed to explain most of the variance in the dataset. 

Naive predictor performance:
We will build a naive predictor that will always predicts Bitcoin prices to go up and will derive accracty for this model. We will later evaluate the model we derive against Naive accuracy.

Creating a training and predicting pipeline
Cross Validation resampling is applied to the data by dividing original dataset in to K equal sized parts without the replacement. Machine learning models(Decision tree, SVM and NN) will be fit on K-1 Part and prediction errors are calculated for the leftout part. Total prediction accuracy is combined after the procedure is repeated for each part.
Model is then tested on testing dataset.

Model Evaluation:
Model performance of (linear regression,SVM, Random forest) are evaluated agaist the time and accuracy.

Optimization:
Based on the accuracy on training and testing dataset and the time they took to run, models will be optimized using various optimizing techniques until desired accuracy is above naive prediction.
