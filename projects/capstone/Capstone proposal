## Proposal


### Domain Background

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. There is lot of buzz about cryptocurrency and everyday in the news we hear volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. 

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The extremely nonlinear nature of the crypto market data makes it very difficult to design a system that can predict the future direction of the crypto prices in Bitcoin with sufficient accuracy. Goal of the project is to predict price movements(that's either up or down) of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

Bitcoin is actual implementation of decentralization issued under the consent of participants not the central bank. Hence variants like purchasing power or interest rate parity does not impact Bitcoin. Bitcoin price is largly impacted by demand and supply.16.5 million Bitcoins are mined since it was created and the Bitcoins are capped at 21 millions part of the reason for scarcity and rush.

Hence to predict Bitcoin price we need to predict Demand and Supply. Block chain is the technology used to create Bitcoin."Block Chain information" along with "Bitcoin" trading information includes features that can determine demand and supply and hence the price.

Therefore, the project uses historic block chain information and Bitcoin trading information to predict future Bitcoin prices.

This project uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory which is publicly available. The data consist of "Bitcoin_Dataset" and "Bitcoin_Prices" which consist of historic Block chain information and Bitcoin prices for  last 4 years.

### Solution Statement

The main goal of speculating a cryptocurrency price is to make profitable trades. To make profitable trades one doesn't need to know accurate value of the cryptocurrency price, but one mearely needs to predict wether prices rise or fall. In these lines we will train our models to classify subsequent day's closing price to be likely higher and lower than the last, based on past 10 days price data.

The solution tests the data on selected features using the models learnt in this course(Decision tree, SVM and CNN) to pick a best model.

### Benchmark Model

We will compare the results with the results of the bitcoin model proposed by Issac Madan, Shaurya Saluja and Aojia Zhao in the below paper
