## Proposal


### Domain Background

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. There is lot of buzz about cryptocurrency and everyday in the news we hear volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. My goal is to understand the volatility in the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and predict the prices. I work in financial industry and I am interested in building a model that could predict the prices.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The goal of the project is to:
Identify any trends within the price changes of Bitcoin and Ethereum
Identify any correlation between the price changes of Bitcoin and Ethereum
Build an algorithm to predict prices and make decisions wether to buy or sell.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

This project uses data from https://coinmarketcap.com/ and https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory which is publicly available. The dataset(Bitcoin_dataset,Etherium_dataset) contains various factors impacting the prices.
These Datasets will be used to identify factors that most impact the prices and Identify any commonality of factors impacting both Bitcoin and Ethrium which later will help in building the algorithm to predict prices.

### Solution Statement

The solution uses feature selection 

_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
